" The intention here is to have a simple means for writing headings in emails,
" and with the bonus of highlighting hyperlinks.

" This file should be in your vimfiles\ftplugin folder,
" and you'll need to (autocmd BufRead,BufNewFile) setlocal ft=email.

" This syntax file is intended to work with my  ../ftplugin/email.vim
"
" Quit when a (custom) syntax file was already loaded
