## vimfiles
All of my `vim` files (except my `.gvimrc` &amp; `.vimrc` - which vary by machine)

### use cases
- scripting ([going faster](https://harriott.github.io/))
- quick navigation around my vast personal notes, which include web addresses

### exploring
Some of my `vim` configuraton files are long, but they don't appear so to me as I use my own `vim_build` filetype, which folds my headings nicely.

### prerequisites
- `gVim`, of course
- The relevant files of this repository correctly symlinked, as in:
    - [ $MSwin10\mb\symlinks-mostly.ps1 ](https://github.com/harriott/OS-MSWin10/blob/master/mb/symlinks-mostly.ps1)
    - [ $OSAB/bs-symlinks/jo-2-whenWM-0.sh ](https://github.com/harriott/OS-ArchBuilds/blob/master/bs-symlinks/jo-2-whenWM-0.sh)
