## vimfiles
All of my vim files (except my .gvimrc &amp; .vimrc - which vary by machine)

### the feel
My gVim installation is setup for coding in Python and Perl, and for quick navigation around my personal notes, as described [here](http://momentary.eu/2013/12/super-charged-it-organisation-with-gvim/).

### prerequisites
`gVim`, of course, and to point to these files, you'll need something like these:

#### MSWin
In your `%UserProfile%`:

- `vimfiles` folder is where you'd clone this repository
- `_vimrc` should at least `source $HOME/vimfiles/MyWin32_vimrc.vim`
- `_gvimrc` should at least `source $HOME/vimfiles/gvimrc.vim`
