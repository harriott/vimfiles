" This file should be in your vimfiles\ftplugin folder.
" $VIMRUNTIME/filetype.vim determines which files are automatically detected as markdown
" for folding to work, you'll need this modeline:  vim: fdm=expr:

setlocal expandtab tw=0

" ALE
let b:ale_enabled = 0

" demote a selected part
vnoremap <buffer><leader>> :s/^#/##/<CR>
" promote a selected part
vnoremap <buffer><leader>< :s/^#//<CR>

" wrap the inner word under cursor with backticks
nnoremap <buffer> <leader>` viwc``<Esc>P

" wrap a selection with backticks
vnoremap <leader>` c``<Esc>P

" folding by header marks

function! MdF()
	let l:hashcount = matchstr(getline(v:lnum), '^#\+') "defined l:hashcount, even in no match
	" if there's a heading set an equivalent fold start
	if empty(l:hashcount) | return "=" | else | return ">".len(l:hashcount) | endif

setlocal fde=MdF() fdc=1 fdm=expr
setlocal fdc=2 " slightly better distinction from line numbers
