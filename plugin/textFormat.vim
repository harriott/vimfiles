set shiftwidth=4

" Clear left & right double & single quotes (as these aren't mapped to a keyboard key):
nnoremap <leader>2 :sil!%s/“/"/g<bar>:sil!%s/”/"/g<bar>:%s/‘/'/g<bar>:%s/’/'/g<cr>

" lesser indentation of vimscript continuation line:
let g:vim_indent_cont = &sw

" Remove all square bracketed text
nnoremap <leader>[ :s/\m\[.\{-}]//g<CR>

" Convert url parenthesis, and various diacritics to percent code
" ---------------------------------------------------------------
" to switch the order of these substitutions, use  s#/\(.\{-}\)/\(.\{-}\)/#/\2/\1/#g
" 5 here means convert to % code (my general preference):
nnoremap <leader>5 :call UnicodePercent()<cr>
